# Chaser Drone - ROS 
## ROS-core, WhyCon, Python, C++
This is a theme-based implementation of an automated Chaser Drone system. 
The drone is programmed to perform motoin in orthogonal coordinate ystem along any line of motion, controlled via real-time feedback control algorithms. Hence, the system adapts to real-time fluctuations due to physical disturbances or noise. 

Proportional - Integral - Derivative (PID) control algorithm is deployed to implement the control system. The error is progressively minimized as the drone learns the external localized arena.
